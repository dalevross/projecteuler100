This will be somewhat like a diary of me learning rust while doing Project Euler

Problem 1 Installed [Rust][rust] and [Rustlings][rustlings]

[Problem 1][p001] [Solution](src/p001.rs) [Template](src/t001.rs)


Problem 2: I figured recursion might not be optimal so tried a thing. Had an oversight 
where I counted the each even value twice. I was annoyed that the ternary operator
didn't exist but the alternative is actually clearer. Renamed the function to run to simplify testing in the future.

Problem 3: Wandered through a few non-optimal solutions before it clicking. I did see a hint I didn't go looking for on the upper limit to use which made sense in the shower then became more clear at church.

[Problem 3][p003] [Solution](src/p003.rs) [Template](src/t003.rs) - 517251st  to solve
