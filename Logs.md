This will be somewhat like a diary of me learning rust while doing Project Euler

Day 1 Installed [Rust][rust] and [Rustlings][rustlings]
[Problem 1][p001] [Solution](src/p001.rs) [Template](src/t001.rs)


Day 2 I figured recursion might not be optimal so tried a thing. Had an oversight 
where I counted the each even value twice. I was annoyed that the ternary operator
didn't exist but the alternative is actually clearer. Renamed the function to run to simplify testing in the future.
[Problem 2][p002] [Solution](src/p003.rs) [Template](src/t002.rs) - 723184th to solve
