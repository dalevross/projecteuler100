[Quincy Larson][qc] shared the following in an [article][art] about resolutions on [freeCodeCamp][fcc]. I rarely ever make resolutions but more on that later.

>The #ProjectEuler100 Challenge - The "Dark Souls" of New Year's Resolutions
>And for all the developers out there who love a challenge, I've created a brand new challenge for your New Year's Resolution.
>
>This will really force you to expand your math and computer science horizons.
>
>It is totally do-able by a new developer. Thousands of people have completed the first 100 Project Euler problems over the years.
>
>It's just brutally hard.
>
>I love Project Euler and used it extensively when I was first learning to code. I love it so much that we added all 600+ Project Euler challenges to freeCodeCamp's Interview Preparation section.
>
>These 600+ challenges get progressively harder - to the point where even people with math PhD's still struggle with them.
>
>But again, the first 100 are do-able for a lay person with some willingness to go down Wikipedia rabbit holes.

>So what do you think. Are you up for working through the first 100 Project Euler problems by the end of 2020?
>
>Here's how the challenge works:
>
>1. Tweet out a photo of yourself giving a thumbs-up and announcing that you are committing to the #ProjectEuler100 challenge.
>2. Create a Git repository.
>3. Each time you complete a challenge, add your solution to your Git repository and tweet a link to it using the #ProjectEuler100 hashtag.
>4. Then scroll through the #ProjectEuler100 hashtag and give supportive feedback on at least 2 tweets from other developers.
>5. Move on to the next Project Euler challenge. You can't skip ahead. You have to complete all 100 challenges in order. But you can use any programming language you want to solve these.
>6. Once you've finished all 100 of them, tweet out a celebration photo. You will have taught yourself a ton of math and computer science, and gotten a lot of programming practice along the way.
>7. You can use the 20-year-old [Project Euler website][pew] itself. Or you can use the [freeCodeCamp.org][fcce] version - which lets you code right in your browser, and has built-in tests.
>
>Remember: you can look at other people's explanations of these Project Euler challenges, but do not copy other people's code directly. You will be tempted to take shortcuts. Resist the temptation. You'll be glad you did.


I'm using the Project Euler Website and since I committed to learning Rust as seen below, that's the language I'll be using.
